Voil√°! In view of a humble, water-bedding, bed linen, passed by careless, both victim and villain, I assert to be. This is ours, no more than that. No more than that of vanity. This a vestige of the vox populi, now defunct, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands verified, and his bold avenging quickness, veino and vehicular, booming bang and vice, and bouts saving the violently vicious and vulgar carriage violating the politician. He only wreaked his vengeance even death held as voted, not to me, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilance and the virtuous. Verily, this is the city's oath of verbiage. There's most of a boast. So let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you. And you may call me, Beanie.
