Voil√†! In view, a humble, waddle-billing, veteran, classed by careless souls, both victim and villain, as a vicious criminal. This is far, no more than that. No more than that of vanity. It's a vestige of the vox populi. Now, victims vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands beatified. And his garbed, benevolent, vein-o-and-grey-birling, barren, bandaged face and vouchsafed, the violently vicious and perfidious violation of volition.

Your only verdict is vengeance, even death. A held is voted, not to me, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilance and the virtuous. Verily, this is the city of verbs. It bears most of the bows. So let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you, and you may call me, Beeny.
