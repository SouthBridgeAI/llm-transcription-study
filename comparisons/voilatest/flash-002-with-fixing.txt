Voila! In view, a humble, wordy villain, vanquished by careless words, both victim and villain are deceased. This is all. No more than that. No more than that. Vanity is a vestige of the vox populi. Now, victims vanish. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands verified, and his garnered goods—vain or grand, burn and be gone in pyres—and vouchsafed in the violently vicious and precarious violation of the coalition. The only verdict is vengeance. Even death held is voted, not to me, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilance and the virtuous. Verily, this discourse is verbose; thus, most verbose. So let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you. And you may call me...Beany.
